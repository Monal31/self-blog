        The beginning …
Hey people out there, reading this…. just another Indian girl discovering her life…having   lot of dreams
 …not knowing what she is up to and not knowing what she’s gonna do after every weekend.     And people!!
  A very big applause to her parents, who guided her in every situation in her life…. A quit different girl 
  from others as she was a single girl child and also being very protective till one end of her life…. 
  The change in her character at one extend made her life more enjoyable… and also maintained the same to enjoy the
   realities in life….
She loves to do every wired thigs…. Yes!!! she’s a crazy type of girl...
Known by many familiar names…studious .silent….violent….cutie pie …bla ..bla…..
she likes to be the favorite one for all… but at a span of time …she was one of the bored one with lack of selflove…. 
 Okay! dude enough of stories now and lets continue it later…see I want all of u to understand that, 
 ”life isn’t about finding yourself…its about creating yourself” so do what you love or you’ll be forced to
  love what you do”…beauty begins the moments you decide to be yourself ….don’t think what others are gonna 
  think about you…because at the end it’s you, and only you!!
You know…. the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are!!
Love your own story even if it hasn’t been the perfect fairy tale…. Which mean I had loved my story and 
letting you all to read it!!.
 The full stop will continue soon….
